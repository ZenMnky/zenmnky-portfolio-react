                        <p>I specialize in designing and building solutions and processes from the ground up to support an organizationâ€™s objectives, managing solution lifecycles from conceptualization thru operationalization. Involved in web application development since December 2019, I bring creative solutions, organization, and collaboration.</p>
                        <p>I am now seeking to contribute my experience and expertise to a software development project in Portland, Oregon, or remotely.</p>
                        <p>Outside of work, I enjoy physical challenges and mountain adventures. Currently, my main physical discipline is AcroYoga.</p>
